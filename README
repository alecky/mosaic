Photo mosaic
------------

I have divided my solution into 3 parts. 

client.js: This part is in charge of ther overall setup and control of the app. 
It assigns the change event to the imput and is in charge of loading the image when
one is selected. Its also sets the height style for each row. It also contains the 
draw row method.

matrix.js: When passed an image this object is in charge of dividing the image up 
and finding the average for each image. It returns a 2 dimensional array that represents 
what the mosaic will look like when its drawn. 

loader.js: This object loads all tiles from the server. It first creates a unique list of 
colours in order of first occurance in the final mosaic. This list is then loaded. After 
each load a check is made to see if all tiles from the current row are loaded and if so 
that row is drawn out. A check is also made after each row if all tiles are loaded but not
all rows and the remaining rows are drawn out.
